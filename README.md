# Journey to Competitive Programming

Hey! Iâ€™m Viena â€” currently grinding my way into the world of **competitive programming**.

Right now Iâ€™m:

- Solving problems on **LeetCode**, following the **Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet** as my main roadmap.
- Building consistency and sharpening fundamentals step by step.

Next up on my path:

- Either diving into **NeetCode 150/250** for more structured practice
- Or making the jump straight to **Codeforces** to test myself in real contests.

Iâ€™m keeping it simple: learn â†’ practice â†’ compete.
