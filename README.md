# ðŸš€ Journey to Competitive Programming

Hey! Iâ€™m **Viena** â€” currently deep into the grind of **competitive programming** and algorithmic problem-solving.

Right now, Iâ€™m primarily focused on solving problems from:

- **Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet** â€” to master the fundamentals step by step
- **NeetCode 250** â€” for additional structured practice and pattern recognition

> Note: There are fewer files in the `neetcode250` directory since many problems overlap with those from the A2Z sheet and are already included in the `a-z` folder instead.
